## An Informal Business Case

ACME is a fintech consulting company who uses an integrated ERP system called "Trackr".

### Problems

1. ACME managers have complained that Trackr's UI is a mile-wide and an inch-deep.
      - Accessing simple utilization reports can be a hassle.

2. Trackr tends to give generic insights, based on hard-coded responses.
      - "This project has fallen below 85% utilization. Maybe you should look into it."

### Objectives

1. Provide deeper insights into data, with the ingenuity of AI.

2. Bypass the frontend of a web application, with Javascript and RESTful API practices.

### Proposed Solution

1. Whispr connects to the Trackr API via endpoint access.

2. Whispr requests a Trackr project report on ACME's largest client, "BigCorp".

3. Whispr parses the response with Javascript.

4. Using the parsed response, Whispr sends an engineered prompt to the GPT API.

5. Whispr outputs a digest of the project report, based on hard data.
